# Bubble Struggle Game
<p>
In this repos we create bubble struggle game with stages. 
At each stage the speed of the balls increases and makes it difficult for the player to win.</p>
<p>
  The Bubble Struggle game starts with one ball and a player who has a shotgun with an arrow and if the ball is hit by the arrow or wire it splits into two smaller balls and so on until it reaches the minimum ball and when it is hit it does not split but disappears.
The game is built with basic physics rules.
There are walls, floor and roof, if the ball hits one of them it is physically thrown by the laws of nature.
When a ball is hit by the player's string or pressure, he also uses the laws of physics.
  The player can move on the floor and every click on spaceboard he shoot the arrow woth the tie.</p>
